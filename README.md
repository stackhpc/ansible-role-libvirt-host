Libvirt Host
============

This role configures a host as a Libvirt/KVM hypervisor. It can also configure
storage pools and networks on the host.

Requirements
------------

The host should have Virtualization Technology (VT) enabled.

Role Variables
--------------

`libvirt_host_pools` is a list of pools to define and start. Each item
should be a dict containing the following items:
- `name` The name of the pool.
- `type` The type of the pool, currently only `dir`, `logical` and `rbd` are
  supported. `lvm2` is supported as an alias for `logical`, but this alias is
  deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
- `capacity`  The capacity, in bytes, of the pool. (optional)
- `path` The absolute path to the pool's backing directory.
- `mode` The access mode of the pool. N.B.: This should be specified as an
  integer **without** a leading zero; for example: `mode: 755`. (only `dir`)
- `owner` The owner of the pool. (only `dir`)
- `group` The group of the pool. (only `dir`)
- `source` The name of the volume group (when type is `logical`) or RBD pool
  (when type is `rbd`).
- `pvs` A list of physical volumes the volume group consists of. (only when
  type is `logical`)
- `hosts` The list of the Ceph monitors IPs or hostnames. (only `rbd`)
- `username` The username used for RADOS authentification. (only `rbd`)
- `passphrase` The passphrase used for RADOS authentification. (only `rbd`)

`libvirt_host_networks` is a list of networks to define and start. Each item
should be a dict containing the following items:
- `name` The name of the network.
- `mode` The forwarding mode of the network, `bridge`, `route` and `nat` are
  supported.
- `bridge` The name of the bridge interface for this network.
- `ip` IP address of the virtual bridge, mandatory for `route` and `nat` mode.
- `netmask` Netmask of the virtual bridge, mandatory for `route` and `nat` mode.
- `domain` DNS domain name for `route` and `nat` mode, default to the network
   name (optional).
- `dhcp_start` First IP of the DHCP range in `route` or `nat` mode (optional).
- `dhcp_end` Last IP of the DHCP range in `route` or `nat` mode (optional).

`libvirt_host_require_vt` is whether to require that Intel Virtualisation
Technology (VT) is enabled in order to run this role. While this provides
better VM performance, it may not be available in certain environments. The
default value is `true`.

`libvirt_host_qemu_emulators`: List of architectures for which to install QEMU
system emulators, e.g.  `x86`. The default value is `['x86']` if

`libvirt_host_require_vt` is `false`, otherwise the default value is an empty
list.

`libvirt_host_enable_efi_support`: Whether to enable EFI support. This defaults 
to false as extra packages need to be installed.

`libvirt_host_var_prefix`: This determines The directory under /var/run that libvirt
uses to store state, e.g unix domain sockets, as well as the default name of the 
PID file. Override this if you have a conflict with the default socket e.g it 
could be in use by the nova_libvirt container. Defaults to `""`.

`libvirt_host_socket_dir`: Where the libvirtd socket is created. Defaults to
`/var/run/{{ libvirt_host_var_prefix }}` if `libvirt_host_var_prefix` is set,
otherwise `""`.

`libvirt_host_pid_path`: Path to PID file which prevents multiple instances of
the daemon from spawning. Defaults to `/var/run/{{ libvirt_host_var_prefix }}.pid` 
if `libvirt_host_var_prefix` is set, otherwise `""`.

`libvirt_host_libvirtd_args`: Command line arguments passed to libvirtd by the
init system when libvirtd is started - quotes will be added

`libvirt_host_uri`: The libvirt connnection URI. Defaults to 
`qemu+unix:///system?socket={{ libvirt_host_socket_dir }}/libvirt-sock` if
`libvirt_host_var_prefix` is set, otherwise `""`. If set to a falsey value,
an explicit connection URI will not be set when calling virsh or any of
the virt_ ansible modules.

`libvirt_host_python3`: Whether the python3 version of the libvirt python
bindings should be installed. If `false`, the python 2 bindings will be
installed.

`libvirt_host_install_daemon`: Whether to install and enable the libvirt
daemon. Default is `true`.

`libvirt_host_install_client`: Whether to install and enable the libvirt
client. Default is `true`.
