- name: Determine path to libvirt environment file
  # On Debian >= 8 and Ubuntu >= 16.04 the libvirt-bin package has been
  # split into libvirt-daemon-system and libvirt-clients. They also seem
  # to have changed to location to enviroment file. To prevent the need
  # to hard code paths for every major version we determine these
  # dynamically. This must be done after installing the package.
  # You cannot guard the with_first_found with a condition without
  # skip being set to true. This is undeseriable so we have to
  # put it behind an include (a block doesn't work).
