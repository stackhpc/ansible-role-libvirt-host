# On Debian >= 8 and Ubuntu >= 16.04 the libvirt-bin package has been
# split into libvirt-daemon-system and libvirt-clients. They also seem
# to have changed to location to enviroment file. To prevent the need
# to hard code paths for every major version we determine these
# dynamically. This must be done after installing the package.
# You cannot guard the with_first_found with a condition without
# skip being set to true. This is undeseriable so we have to
# put it behind an include (a block doesn't work).
